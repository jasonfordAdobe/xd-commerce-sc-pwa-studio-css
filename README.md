# XD Plugin for PWA Studio Kit

Aim is to make simple changes to the PWA Studio Kit within XD, and quickly copy over the CSS to an actual PWA.

It's not intended to build a PWA from XD! Don't have your expectations too high!

## This is a work in progress!!!

### What it does

* Reads the Colours from the PWA Studio Kit
* Creates all the colour shades
* Outputs CSS to the clipboad

### Ideas to look into

* Font output
* Script to create the correct override files automatically in PWA Studio
* Test....a lot
